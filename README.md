## ðŸ“‘ Pre-requisites
Node.js, and Node Package Manager (NPM) are required.

## âš™ Google Drive API Setup
In the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/),
- Setup your application

## ðŸ›  Setting up your config file
The config file is needed to be able to run the application locally. At this point, you should have a **Google Drive API key** and **Client ID**.

Create a `config.js` file in the `src` folder.

Format the file as so. Replace the placeholder text with the necessary information. Do not remove the quotes.
```
export const config = {
    web: {
        api_key: "Paste API Key Here",
        client_id: "Paste Client ID Here",
     }
}
```

## ðŸš€ Running the applicaiton
Install all dependencies by typing in `npm install`.

Then, type `npm start` to run the app in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the application in your browser.
